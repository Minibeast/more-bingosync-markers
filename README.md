# More Bingosync Markers
Adds more options to bingosync boards, allowing players to have more specific square markers.

## Usage
Install the extension as you would any unpacked extension for the particular browser you're using.

Press CTRL + Right click to place a "warning" sign, press ALT + Right click to place a "stop" sign.

## Development
- Add more customizability with the extension (change keybindings in a menu, change images, etc).

I had an issue getting images to work on chromium-based browsers, as the images would refuse to embed with `<img>` when using the runtime url. If anyone has a fix please let me know.
